These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n","* Get the index of the place given its name.\n","* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all places. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first element is its position and the second is the similarity score.\n","* Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity scores; that is, the second element.\n","* Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it refers to self (the place most similar to a particular place is the place itself).\n","* Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":114,"metadata":{"_uuid":"9c383fcbb916dce464b01adf980d26ad96aebe0e","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138809Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138491Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.145396Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.144203Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138750Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/var/folders/2s/0csdzgrs4gs5qz5648kq8qtr0000gn/T/ipykernel_3732/2254651051.py:15: UserWarning: Boolean Series key will be reindexed to match DataFrame index.\n","  filtered_places = df.iloc[place_indices][df['budget'] <= budget]\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>place_name</th>\n","      <th>place_id</th>\n","      <th>average_rating</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Roasting House</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>Al-Rahmaniyah Park</td>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>12</th>\n","      <td>Lock'n'Load Egypt</td>\n","      <td>13</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>19</th>\n","      <td>The Greek Village</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>25</th>\n","      <td>Al Horreya Park</td>\n","      <td>26</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>32</th>\n","      <td>Beit El Sennari</td>\n","      <td>33</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>33</th>\n","      <td>I Bistro Bar, Cairo</td>\n","      <td>34</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>44</th>\n","      <td>Code to Escape Egypt</td>\n","      <td>45</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>46</th>\n","      <td>Aswan High Dam</td>\n","      <td>47</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>49</th>\n","      <td>Aqua Park</td>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["              place_name  place_id  average_rating\n","2         Roasting House         3             5.0\n","7     Al-Rahmaniyah Park         8             5.0\n","12     Lock'n'Load Egypt        13             5.0\n","19     The Greek Village        20             5.0\n","25       Al Horreya Park        26             5.0\n","32       Beit El Sennari        33             5.0\n","33   I Bistro Bar, Cairo        34             5.0\n","44  Code to Escape Egypt        45             5.0\n","46        Aswan High Dam        47             5.0\n","49             Aqua Park        50             5.0"]},"execution_count":114,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["def get_similar_places(place_name, keywords=[], budget=np.inf, cosine_sim=cosine_sim, df=df):\n","    #
