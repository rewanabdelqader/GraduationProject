These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n","* Get the index of the place given its name.\n","* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all places. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first element is its position and the second is the similarity score.\n","* Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity scores; that is, the second element.\n","* Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it refers to self (the place most similar to a particular place is the place itself).\n","* Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"_uuid":"9c383fcbb916dce464b01adf980d26ad96aebe0e","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138809Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138491Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.145396Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.144203Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-30T20:00:39.138750Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/var/folders/2s/0csdzgrs4gs5qz5648kq8qtr0000gn/T/ipykernel_27030/2254651051.py:15: UserWarning: Boolean Series key will be reindexed to match DataFrame index.\n","  filtered_places = df.iloc[place_indices][df['budget'] <= budget]\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>place_name</th>\n","      <th>place_id</th>\n","      <th>average_rating</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>298</th>\n","      <td>The Halls Egypt</td>\n","      <td>154</td>\n","      <td>4.98</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>951</th>\n","      <td>6th Dimension Egypt</td>\n","      <td>970</td>\n","      <td>4.98</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>114</th>\n","      <td>The Escape Room Egypt</td>\n","      <td>187</td>\n","      <td>4.96</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>390</th>\n","      <td>Roasting House</td>\n","      <td>321</td>\n","      <td>4.96</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>453</th>\n","      <td>Sharm Plaza</td>\n","      <td>613</td>\n","      <td>4.96</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>41</th>\n","      <td>Escape Egypt</td>\n","      <td>829</td>\n","      <td>4.95</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>499</th>\n","      <td>Yalla Bina</td>\n","      <td>407</td>\n","      <td>4.95</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>640</th>\n","      <td>Caffe Greco</td>\n","      <td>385</td>\n","      <td>4.95</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>251</th>\n","      <td>The Bakery</td>\n","      <td>220</td>\n","      <td>4.94</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>274</th>\n","      <td>Indigo Beach Club, Hurghada</td>\n","      <td>149</td>\n","      <td>4.94</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                      place_name  place_id  average_rating\n","298              The Halls Egypt       154            4.98\n","951          6th Dimension Egypt       970            4.98\n","114        The Escape Room Egypt       187            4.96\n","390               Roasting House       321            4.96\n","453                  Sharm Plaza       613            4.96\n","41                  Escape Egypt       829            4.95\n","499                   Yalla Bina       407            4.95\n","640                  Caffe Greco       385            4.95\n","251                   The Bakery       220            4.94\n","274  Indigo Beach Club, Hurghada       149            4.94"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["def get_similar_places(place_name, keywords=[], budget=np.inf, cosine_sim=cosine_sim, df=df):\n","    #
